# eslint-config

## Personal eslint configuration for personal projects

This is very much a maximalist config; I set every current, non-deprecated core JS rule, every React rule, and every React Hooks rule. This means it also handles all code style/formatting, and cannot be used with Prettier. The settings are pretty custom and while I like them, I'd use Prettier and something more standard and maintainable for a production project, like Google, Airbnb, or Standard configs. I created and uploaded this so I could share it across projects, especially given that eslint deprecating `/~` level configs, but it's not really intended to be public.
